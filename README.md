Bank Note Authentication - TensorFlow

Loan Repayment Predictor - TensorFlow

Movie Review Text Classification - TensorFlow


### Rotten Tomatoes: Sentiment Analysis (Kaggle)
Used TensorFlow neural networks to solve the Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews Kaggle competition. The dataset contains syntactic subphrases of Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews. The task is to label the phrases as positive or negative on a scale from 1 to 5. The aim is not label the entire review, but individual phrases from within the reviews, which is a more difficult task.
